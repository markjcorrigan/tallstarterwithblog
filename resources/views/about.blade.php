            <p align="left">The above said, I am 
								constantly amazed by many I speak to who totally 
								disregard the above &quot;state of affairs,&quot; 
								while 
								fanatically insisting on hyping on and on about agile!&nbsp; 
								One person said to me, when I explained that 
								agile was not on the above <a href="/?slide=2" title="The Standards / Frameworks Landscape slide #2" target="_blank">Standards, Frameworks 
								matrix</a>: &quot;Yes but how old is your diagram?&quot;&nbsp; 
								I thought to myself, &quot;<a href="/images/birdbrain.jpg" target="_blank">Your point taken and rejected</a>, my point (<a href="/?slide=2" title="The Standards / Frameworks Landscape slide #2" target="_blank">if you look carefully at the Standards Frameworks Landscape</a>) totally 
								misunderstood by you!"<br><br>Don't get me 
								wrong. I love agile and especially Scrum:&nbsp; 
								But only If well run using the Scrum processes that are defined and operate at CM Level 2+!<br>(<a href="/" target="_blank" title="The PMBOK Dashboard clearly shows the Knowledge Areas that need monitoring and control for project success">With 
								lapsed traditional project management controls</a> 
								that very often occur with agile, 
								it will have to be 
			<a href="/scrumrca#indexc" target="_blank"><u><b>run very well</b></u></a> 
			(regularly <a href="/workingsoftware" target="_blank">demonstrating and releasing working software</a>) to mitigate serious risks 
								associated with agile's loose approach!) ELSE AGILE IS NO BETTER THAN BADLY (CM L1) RUN TRADITIONAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT!
								<a href="/?slide=12" target="_blank"> <br>
								<br>A deeper look at the section 
								in PMWay on Scrum here 
							</a> will 
								clearly explain why processes should be 
								correctly used at Capability 
								Maturity Level 2+ for success; which (if you 
								joint the dots at the bottom of the home page) 
								will also explain what 
								this web site is all about.&nbsp; <br>Operating at 
								Capability Maturity Level 1, especially with 
								agile, must surely be, as I often see, from a 
								project management perspective, a recipe for 
								disaster!<br>Following the SBOK (Scrum Body 
								of Knowledge) processes more closely on the 
								other hand will greatly assist in improving the 
								agile (Scrum) project's success rate!&nbsp; 
								Appreciating the PMBOK processes (mindful also 
								of joining all the dots found on the home page) 
								as a "best way to run projects," when using 
								agile must further reduce risk and waste while 
								improving productivity and quality.<br>Take 
								the PMWay&nbsp;<a href="/pin" target="_blank" >pin test</a> 
								now if you want to ascertain your application of project method and associated risk exposure.<br>
								<br>This image 
								below, from the PRINCE2 agile manual, in my mind 
								succinctly illustrates that while agility 
								is awesome, it must not come about at the expense of well engineered 
								software solutions.<br>
								<a href="/agileisdead" target="_blank" title="Death of Agile?"><img alt="PRINCE2 Agile" class="img-fluid" src="/images/p2afighter.png"></a><br>(If interested click the image 
								above to jump to an 
								excellent talk about the death of Agile (with a 
								capital A); from one of the guys who attended 
								Snowbird in Utah and gave us <a href="/agile?slide=12" target="_blank" title="Click here for the Agile Manifesto">the 
								agile manifesto</a>)<br><br>Therefore, because I appreciate the PMBOK's value to assist me to run my Programs and Projects
                                    better, in
                                    the interest of project management process improvement, you are
                                    welcome to use the assets you find here.<br><br>
								<em><strong>Note:&nbsp; </strong></em>Unlike Business As Usual (BAU) a 
								project is a temporary undertaking!&nbsp; <br>Again I am consistently amazed at companies who bundle what are essentially project management processes into BAU!?<br>
								They also appear to be bundling 
								the SS, SD and ST ITIL processes into BAU 
								(essentially SO) stating that DevOps is a replacement for ITIL best practice!?<br>
								It is obvious to anyone who understand the ITIL processes that SS, SD and ST processes exist in the project management domain and are intended to assist the organization to "<a href="/?slide=7" target="_blank">mind the gap" / "avoid getting stuck in the tar pit."</a><br>
								In 
								essence (via 
								the project) you are &quot;<a href="/vmodel" target="_blank">jumping a gap</a>&quot; from 
								one baseline to a new (improved) baseline which import, if lost, means that the organization essentially will surely get stuck (lost) in the tar pit.<br><br>Also, from a 
								P3O perspective the project can be run alone or 
								as an essential building block of Portfolio's and 
								Programs.<br><br>And from the perspective of the project
								itself, scheduled TAsks (Time Asks) are the essence 
								of project management.&nbsp; <br>(This truth is 
								found in <a href="/" target="_blank">processes 4.2, 6.5, 4.3, 4.5 
								in the PMBOK 6 Dashboard</a>.&nbsp;

                                        To this end we must always ensure that projects are kept sweet and
                                        simple, lean and agile, and that an achievable set of goals for the
                                        team is rapidly created for them to rally behind and deliver

                                    <br><br>It is a fact, in the sixth edition of the PMBOK&#174; Guide, each knowledge
                                    area contains a new section entitled <strong>Approaches for Agile,
                                        Iterative and Adaptive Environments</strong>.&nbsp;
								For a specialized qualification in agile 
								consider the <strong>PMI Agile Certified Practitioner 
								(PMI-ACP)</strong>.&nbsp; This formally recognizes 
								your knowledge of agile principles and your 
								skill with agile techniques (including XP, 
								Scrum, Lean and KanBan etc.).<br>If you think that the PMBOK is 
								outdated because it is &quot;waterfall,&quot; I challenge 
								you to work through the PMBOK 
								&quot;How To&quot; (from the main menu).  If you do this then I believe you will 
								come to understand that your assumptions are incorrect and do not fully grasp all the 
								pertinent issues.  To illustrate why I say this 
								take the pin test now and ask yourself
								honestly:<br>

<a href="/homeviewpdf/resources/itilfouroverview.pdf" target="_blank">This presentation</a> gives an overview of some of the ideas I have been playing with.  These are expanded <a href="/?slide=1" target="_blank">here if you connect the dots.</a>
<br>
<br>Be aware that in a short time this web site has grown rapidly.  <br>It is now over 800 gigabytes in size, filled with thousands of pages and resources as I proceeded with my investigation.
<br><br>It is worth knowing that <b><a href="/home/nottwentyfourseven"><u>PMWay is not available 24/7</u></a></b>.  <br>
Due to high cost involved in hosting a large web site I decided to host PMWay myself.  
<br>As such, if I have my server up and running the site will be visible to you.<br>
This mode of operation is by design and is suitable for my needs as I will ensure PMWay is up when needed.<br>If you need me to bring it up for you please contact me.</p>
